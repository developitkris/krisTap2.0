# React Taproom

This website is built using React and JSX.  It will be a recreation of a previous Taproom project built with Angular.

By Kristi Hwang

## Description

This is a website for a beer taproom which displays and monitors taps. It will have the following features:

1. Home page with company name and welcome message
2. List of all brews
3. Collapsable info for a specific brew
3. About page

## Project Specs

* User should be able to load web browser to the homepage and see a welcome message
* User should be able to see and click on routes to navigate to different "pages" of the website
* User should be able to see a list of brews and its associated information including: brew name, brewery, abv, price, description, keg fill

## Thoughts
The mindset of starting a project in React versus one in Angular is markedly different because of its functional approach.  Although both contain Components, these structures translate differently in their application.  React handles its components more as independent standing entities, while Angular assigns a certain task for them to be non mutually exclusive.  React seems to take a simpler approach to its components, containing everything related to that component in a single file.  Angular creates a set of files for a newly generated component, and each of the files within it need to be maintained separately. So in that way, there is more specificity in Angular but React's approach seems more usable.  There is the distinction that while Angular is a full framework, React remains a library.  So considering that, Angular has more extensive built-in features that React won't have.  But given React's popularity and flexibility, it seems a good approach to  think how we can add to a project by using React in conjunction to Angular.
